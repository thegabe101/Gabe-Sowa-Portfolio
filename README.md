# Gabe's Portfolio

## Description

- Motivation: The motivation for this project was creating a space in which to display my work in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other coding languages I will learn over time. 
- I built this project in accordance challenge guidelines but tried to customize it to reflect my personal work and style.
- This project is meant to solve the issue of having no centralized portfolio space in which to share and publish my work. Everything (or, most things) I do throughout this class and beyond will be published here. 
- I learned an immense amount on the intricacies of CSS and the power a learned coder has to customize a webpage to their tastes. I also learned how much patience one is required to have when designing something that needs to look just right.
